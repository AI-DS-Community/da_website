# The Web Slasher

Every web dev aspires to make a polished website but they all end up straying towards unethical features. We aim to bring awareness towards these unethical and annoying features web devs implement.

Develop a website that contains the most unethical and annoying features a website can have.

## Details

| Type   | Team Size | Fee (per head) |
| ------ | --------- | -------------- |
| Online | 1 - 3     | 50             |

## Rules & Guidelines

-   Our mission is to expose these unethical and annoying features that web developers use.
-   Build a website with most unethical and annyoing features.
-   The website must not utilize any third-party services, libraries or code (this involves services like shorte.st, libraries like React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and frameworks like Vue). JQuery is an exception since most of jQuery's features can be achieved with modern JavaScript.
-   The website must be a submitted as a single HTML file. All styles and scripts must be written inside that single file.
-   Annoying features should not contain explicit content but can make satirical references.
