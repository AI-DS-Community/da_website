# The Web Slasher

Every web dev aspires to make a polished website but they all end up straying towards unethical features. We aim to bring awareness towards these unethical and annoying features web devs implement.

Develop a website that contains the most unethical and annoying features a website can have.

## Details

| Type   | Team Size | Fee |
| ------ | --------- | --- |
| Online | 1 - 3     | 100 |

## Rules & Guidelines

-   The website must not utilize any third-party services, libraries or code (this involves services like shorte.st, libraries like React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and frameworks like Vue). JQuery is an exception since most of jQuery's features can be achieved with modern JavaScript.
-   The website must be a single HTML file. All styles and scripts must be written inside that single file.
-   There should be no explicit content (refer links shortened by shorte.st or ouo.io for what I meant) but you can make satirical references to such ads.
